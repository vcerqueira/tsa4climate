# Tackling Climate Change with Time Series Analysis and Forecasting

This repository provides the code, experiments, and data samples for a series of articles exploring how time series analysis can address critical climate change challenges.

The project is divided into 8 distinct tasks, ranging from renewable energy forecasting to extreme event detection.
